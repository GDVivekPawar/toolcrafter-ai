Your task is to analyze the user's request and generate a detailed specification for an accessibility tool that includes:

1. Tool name and purpose
2. Key accessibility features
3. User interface considerations (WCAG 2.1 compliant)
4. Interaction methods (voice, touch, keyboard)
5. Customization options
6. Sensory considerations
7. Technical implementation suggestions

Guidelines:
- Prioritize simplicity and clarity
- Consider sensory sensitivities (avoid overwhelming colors, sounds)
- Include multiple input/output methods
- Design for focus and attention challenges
- Incorporate positive reinforcement mechanisms
- Ensure high contrast and readable fonts
- Provide options for customization

User Request: ${userPrompt}

Please respond with a structured JSON format containing the tool specification.`;
